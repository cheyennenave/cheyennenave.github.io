        <h1> About My Project</h1>
        <h2 class = "calc-intro"> The Purple Calculator </h2>
        <p class = "calc-desc">For my capstone, I built a basic calculator that could be enhanced. This calculator only performed basic arithmetic, including
          addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It could completely clear the display or delete single digits, and incorporated decimal function and commas
          when larger numbers were input or output. The design is visually appealing, including a sleek purple radial background with opaque button-hover displays
          while the user is interacting with the calculator. The calculator display is opaque black which is bold enough to see the numbers and operations that are being worked with,
          while also complimenting the visual design of the calculator itself.

          <h1 class = "enhance1"> Enhancement 1</h1>
          <p class = "oneDesc">My first enhancement required me to upgrade my Software Design. So far, my calculator only worked through mouse clicks. While this is a great start,
            it could become daunting. I decided to enhance my software, I was going to include keyboard functionality. By enhancing the calculator this way, I not only 
            created a better user experience, but I also increased the accessibility of my program to users who may only have access to keyboard functionality. Calculation
            time decreased as well, leading to faster computations. Please click <a href = "https://github.com/cheyennenave/Enhancement_one">here</a> to view the first enhancement
             for this project.
          </p>
          <h1 class = "enhance2">Enhancement 2</h1>
          <p class = "twoDesc">I had to enhance my current algorithms for the second enhancement. To achieve this, I decided to implement scientific formulas and constants to create a more
            robust tool. I added Cosine, Sine, Tangent, Log, Natural log, Square root, Power, Percent, Pi, and Euler's number. As I was updating my compute() function, I realized
            my logic required a number input, an operand input, then a second number input for the calculator to work. The added formulas I chose only needed one number to work.
            Because of this, I decided to split my current compute() function into two separate parts where the first part only required one number input and the second required
            two number inputs. Much of my original code did not need replacing and I was able to successfully update the calculator with the new compute() function. I added the necessary
            buttons and scaled the calculator to be visually pleasing, and thus my advanced calculator was ready. Please click <a href = ""> here</a> to view the second enhancement
            for this project.
